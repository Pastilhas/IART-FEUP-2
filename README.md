# ZHED - IART project

## Introduction

[ZHED](http://www.playzhed.com/) is a puzzle game with a simple mechanic. It is not timed or scored, only relies on focus and memory.
To play you tap numbered squares and select a direction. This will create a path to the goal. Once you fill the goal square, you can move to the next level.

## Artificial Inteligence

The goal of this project is to develop an artificial inteligence using reinforcement learning.

## Getting Started
